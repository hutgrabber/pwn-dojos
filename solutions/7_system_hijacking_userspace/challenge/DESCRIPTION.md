For this homework assignment you are going to create an entry stub trampoline. You will be patching a server that will load in your shared library. You will need to patch the beginning of `encryptedPrint` to jump to your code, print the flag, and then have it call back the original function. 

Note you need to be able to not only print the flag, but call the original function to get full credit for this assignment.
