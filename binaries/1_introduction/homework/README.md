# Week 1
## Classwork

For the week 1 homework, you are looking to do a ret2win. Use the things that utilized in class today to figure out how to solve this. 

Where to find the challenge: 
- `/challenge/ret2win`

It will print out the flag inside of `/root`. It is only readable by root (which you do not have access to). Exploit `ret2win` to get the contents of the flag and then submit it!
