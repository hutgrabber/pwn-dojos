# Sandboxing 
## Classwork

Everything you need is located here: 
- `/challenge/main.c
-  /challenge/Makefile`

To compile, all you need to do is run make inside of the directory containing main.c and the Makefile. 

Please note that you ***may*** need to move both of these files to your Documents directory to get it to compile correctly.
